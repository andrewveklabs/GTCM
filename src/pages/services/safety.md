### SAFETY

Safety is an essential part of our business. In an industry that is driven by deadlines, **Golden Triangle’s** philosophy is to integrate safety into all aspects of our work - and throughout the entire lifecycle of each project. With safety at the forefront, we are constantly diligent in ensuring that our job sites are safe working environments.
This commitment extends beyond my role as President of **Golden Triangle Construction Management Inc.** This means that all employees, tradesmen, subcontractors, and other personnel understand and abide by our corporate safety policies and procedures outlined in our Corporate Safety Manual, the Occupational Health and Safety Act and all other applicable rules and regulations.
Golden Triangle has achieved a high standard of excellence in safety, acknowledged by the **Alberta Construction Safety Association** and co-signed by the **Director of Workplace Partnerships (Alberta Employment and Immigration).**
