**Golden Triangle** can also provide facility leasing services as an alternative to real estate ownership. Design Build/Leaseback provides a tailored approach to meet our client’s specific operating and financial needs. Under this scenario, we provide our skilled Design-Build services for a project whereby the leaseback terms are part of the contract. The result is a building that suits their specific requirements, designed and constructed with potentially no initial capital outlay. Our niche is simply to provide the space needed in a timely manner and work with the client so that their monthly costs for the physical space is manageable.
As the general contractor, Golden Triangle provides general tender services, (often referred to as stipulated sum general contracting). In this more traditional and linear approach to construction, these projects are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process upon completion of drawings and specifications.
**Golden Triangle’s** roles and responsibilities as the general contractor are to execute the fully developed plan and design within a defined project scope and for a stipulated price. Our deliverables fall under our Construction Management services and include quality and safety control, site inspection, contract administration, commissioning, and turnover.
