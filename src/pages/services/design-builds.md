Through our single point of accountability, **Golden Triangle** can provide feasibility and early confirmation of project pricing prior to our clients committing to expenses of land acquisition and designs. The clientâ€™s project risk is further minimized through a guaranteed maximum price for the project. This approach reduces the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of each project. Through this overlap of architects, trades, and suppliers input, along with approvals and construction, schedules are enhanced and time and resources are utilized efficiently.
